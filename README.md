# Mission to Mars
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create an app that can be run from a website that will scrape various websites that include data and images on the planet Mars and have the data and images displayed. Splinter was used to scrape the websites and beautiful soup was used for the website design and display. A no SQL Mongo database was created to store the data and images for analysis and reporting. 

## Results
The final website includes a button that when clicked will scrape the websites and return updated data, as the data on the web changes constantly. The data returned includes a headline and brief snippet of the latest Mars news, a featured Mars image, a table of general facts on Mars relative to Earth, and finally, four images of the four hemispheres of Mars. The images should size appropriately on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Other changes were made to the look and feel of the website, but more work can definitely be done.
